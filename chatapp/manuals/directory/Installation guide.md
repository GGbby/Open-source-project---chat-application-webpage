## * Start the application



### Set up the server side:
#### Intstall the XMAPP
It is easy to install, just go to install the install package at [XMAPP's download page](https://www.apachefriends.org/zh_tw/download.html).
If there is still problem on installing it. I suggest you go to this tutorial.ðŸ‘‰[Go here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJx4eknf7jM&list=PLwIFDX7xv6k0DFTPpu1wTr8cuc2VC91bW
) 
After finishing installing it, I had some problem on the permission of it. There is a way to solve it.ðŸ‘‰[Go here](https://errerrors.blogspot.com/2018/11/how-to-fix-cannot-create-file-xampp-control-ini.html)ðŸ‘ˆ It is actually just giving XMAPP a permission to write-in. On my computer the default setting didn't give the write-in permission to it. And it will crash when I quit XMAPP.

So, now we should have the XMAPP installed. And we now have to open the XMAPP control panel and turn on the Apache and MySQL.

And then go to [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) on your browser and create a database call ```chat```.

Then set up two tables name ```users```, and ```messages```. For ```users``` needs to set up `7` columns. And ```messages``` with `4` columns. And the elements are show below.

After setting the users table, there is still some setting. Press the ```GO``` button below. And create a new column call `status` after `img`.

### Now we have to clone the repository:
Make sure your `git` is ready. Go to the location your install the xmapp.
For example, I install it at `D:`. So my location is `D:\xampp\htdocs`.

Go to the location and clone the repository.
type `git clone https://github.com/GGbby/Open-source-project---chat-application-webpage.git`




### Now you should have the whole stuff ready:
Go to a browser. And go to the localhost of this project. It should be like:`http://localhost/Open-source-project---chat-application-webpage/`
